# Supervised-chess-AI

This is an initial attempt at creating a chess AI using supervised learning with a tensorflow model

After creating a dataset using dataset_gen.py (thus far tested with around 250000 chess positions), the positions are analysed with stockfish 15.
All positions are randomised in a way that they would be helpful for the AI. 
Instead of randomising the positions completely (placing a random number of random pieces on random squares), the positions are generated by making some random number of moves starting from the initial staring position.

Using tensorflow's keras module, the data is fitted with a sequential model and can then be played against.
