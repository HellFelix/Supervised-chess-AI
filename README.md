# Supervised-chess-AI

This is an initial attempt at creating a chess AI using supervised learning with a tensorflow model

After creating a dataset using dataset_gen.py (thus far tested with around 250000 chess positions), the positions are analysed with stockfish 15.
All positions are randomised in a way that they would be helpful for the AI. 
Instead of randomising the positions completely (placing a random number of random pieces on random squares), the positions are generated by making some random number of moves starting from the initial staring position.

Using tensorflow's keras module, the data is fitted with a sequential model and can then be played against.
In when running main.py, the program will display choices of gamemodes that can be played. 

"challenge" gives the option of playing the ai yourself. The ai always plays white and the input for playing is a combination of the square you're moving from to the square you're moving to. For instance. moving a piece from a4 to g7, you would input "a4g7".

"random" makes the ai play against random moves, the program will display the game in the terminal while it plays the game.

The interface.py module is an attempt to give the ai an interactive interface to interact with. The game is playable, but the ai cannot yet interact with it. I hope to come back to this project in the future and fix this.
